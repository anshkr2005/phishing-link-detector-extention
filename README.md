# phishing-link-detector-extention

A phishing link detector web browser extension is a security tool designed to protect users from malicious websites that attempt to steal personal information. This extension works by analyzing URLs in real-time, identifying and blocking suspicious or harmful links. It leverages databases of known phishing sites and advanced algorithms to detect potentially fraudulent pages. When a user clicks on a link, the extension quickly scans it, and if it finds any red flags, it alerts the user and prevents access to the site. This proactive approach helps safeguard users' sensitive data, such as passwords and financial information, ensuring a safer browsing experience.
